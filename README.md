# Alpha-beta-pruning

Alphaâ€“beta pruning is a search algorithm that decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm. It is an adversarial search algorithm used commonly for machine playing of two-player games (Tic-tac-toe, Chess, Go, etc.). It stops completely evaluating a move when at least one has been found that worse than a previously examined move. Such moves need not be evaluated further. When applied to a standard minimax tree, it returns the same move as minimax would, but prunes away branches that cannot influence the final decision.
